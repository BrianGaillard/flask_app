# EO-AI

Website

https://eo-ai.herokuapp.com/

Purpose
---------------------
This web application is designed to help the residents of East Orange learn more about what the city does. Specifically, it can use models to predict what the budget, expenditures, and tax for municipal purposes will be. The app also provides some information on AI and its uses. 

Functionality
---------------------
This app utilizes univariate linear regression models to predict what the values will be for the budget and tax in the future. Data from the East Orange website is utilized. Using the 9 years of data found on this site, we can predict with relative accuracy the values for coming years (to an extent). The user inputs a year and the program outputs the predicted financial values for that year, along with graphs that show the trend in the original data.

Tools
---------------------
The app uses Flask as a web framework, and the app itself is hosted on Heroku.
